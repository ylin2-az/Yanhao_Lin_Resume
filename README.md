# Lab 4
MIS547 Online Lab 4

## Introduction
In this lab, you will generate a static website to display your resume, and then deploy your site to DigitalOcean's AppPlatform. 

This lab covers a few key topics in Cloud Native computing: we will build on your existing containerization skills, introduce using configuration-as-code with YAML, as well as start your journey with using Platform as a Service primitives (in this case, using AppPlatform). 

By the end of the lab, you will have an online resume that you can use for highlighting your experience to recruiters, without having to send PDF copies to their inboxes. 

## About Static Site Generators
A static site is a website where the HTML is built in advance, rather than being generated dynamically when users visit the website. 

You'll use a tool called a **static site generator** to complete this lab. A static site gernerator is a tool that takes your content, usually written in Markdown, and uses pre-defined templates to turn your content into a complete set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. 

Static site generators are often used for blogs, documentation sites, and portfolios where content doesn't change frequently and you don't need complex user interactions or real-time data.

There are a few popular static site generators, including Jekyll, which is Ruby-based, Hugo, which is go-based, Gatsby and Next.js, which are JavaScript/React-based, and Pelican, which is Python-based. We'll be using **Hugo** in this lab. Hugo is a fast static site generator written in Go that transforms Markdown content into HTML websites. 

## About Hugo
Hugo uses a Markdown parser to read your .md files and convert the Markdown syntax into an internal representation of the document structure. Hugo takes the parsed content and injects it into HTML templates. You define templates that specify where the content goes, how the navigation should look, what the header/footer contain, etc. Hugo extracts metadata from the top of your Markdown files, typically written in YAML, TOML, or JSON format. 

Hugo is often cited as the fastest static site generator, capable of building large sites in milliseconds. Hugo also inlcudes a development server built-in with hot reloading, so you can see changes instantly as you write. 

## About Templates
Templates are key to static site generators success. There are large libraries of community-created templates that help you create static sites for all kinds of purposes. Hugo uses Go's template language, which allows for highly customizable logic and data manipulation. Take a look at [Hugo's theme community](https://themes.gohugo.io/) to see what's possible just using open source templates.  

## Instructions

In [part 1](/part1/README.md), you'll generate a static website using Hugo to display your resume. You'll edit your resume by updating YAML files instead of writing HTML.

In [part 2](/part2/README.md), you'll deploy your website to DigitalOcean's App Platform. 

Along the way, you'll learn a little more about Docker Compose, Git Submodules, and Platform as a Service. 

We'll be using entirely open source code to create our static website, including [the theme that we'll use to generate our resumes](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/resume-a4/). If you would like to use a different theme for your resume, you are welcome to, however, debugging any issues in other open source themes will be up to you- the class won't be able to support your development efforts if you choose to use a different theme.

To submit your lab, in the course space Assignment submission box, paste the link generated by AppPlatform when you deploy your static site on DigitalOcean. Your URL will have a unique subdomain followed by `.ondigitalocean.app/`
